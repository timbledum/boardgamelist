# Board game website ideas #

- Static website
- Two JSON files
    - One with the board game IDs
    - One with downloaded information from BBG
- A script that refreshes board game data from BBG and downloads images
- A collection of pages that sort the games in different ways:
    - Ranking
    - Weight
    - Length (in categories?)
    - Category / ranking
    - Number of players / ranking
    - Age
- A way to build the website and publish to github pages
- A pleasing template (probably only need one file)
- Must have categories and ranking
- Must have links to BBG
